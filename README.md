Implementation of a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Here I have used the dataset of kaggle. The link is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
Using Linear Regression as the model for trainig the model did not find it very much suitable cause it was  giving an accuracy rate of only 70 percent.
The house  prediction model dataset had a train dataset and a testing dataset . I used Data Visulization using histograms to find out the best possible training datas from the compete dataset of something 1500 rows and various columns.
